# DESIGN-AND-ANALYSIS-OF-A-PLASTIC-ABS-CHAIR-INSPIRED-BY-SPIDER-WEB.
# Abstract:
The present paper is aimed at solid modeling and FEM analysis of a chair made 
up of plastic (ABS) thermoplastic polymer material. This is an attempt to 
evaluate the feasibility and strength of a plastic (ABS) chair with stiffener 
mounted below which is inspired by a spider web. As the structural 
performance and material required of any product is utmost important to the 
manufacturers, it is essential for the product designers to build a prototype and 
test it under different loading conditions. Owing to the complexities involved in 
the deformation process, a powerful analysis technique (finite element analysis) 
has been applied to validate the product prototype.

# Methodology: 
Basically our design is an inspiration from the nature or we can call it a nature 
inspired design. This idea was taken from the nature by observing the intricate 
designs of the “SPIDER WEB”
